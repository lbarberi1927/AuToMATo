Code for the paper called ``AuToMATo: A Parameter-Free Persistence-Based Clustering Algorithm'' by Huber, Kalisnik and Schnider.

To run the scripts reproducing the results and figures in the paper, run ``python3 -m eval.eval``, ``python3 -m mapper_applications.make_diabetes_pictures`` or ``python3 -m mapper_applications.make_synth_pictures``.

If the TTK-clustering algorithm is to be included in evaluation (uncomment relevant lines in eval.py to do so), ParaView and the Topology ToolKit must be installed.
